  By not providing "Findfrenet_conversion.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this

  "frenet_conversion", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "frenet_conversion"
  with any of the following names:

    frenet_conversionConfig.cmake
    frenet_conversion-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "frenet_conversion" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "frenet_conversion_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "frenet_conversion" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
